# PHYSICAL DATA BOX

This project can bring you the feeling of touching virutal data like music, pictures, apps, documents.

First we wanted to build something like the Spotify Box from Jordi Alba (http://blog.zenona.com/) but as we thought about 
the the other virutal data on the computer that can be opened with RFID-Tags we choose to make something more universally.

Our project works with node.js, RC522(RFID Card R/W), serialport, open, exec.

The next steps are:

- create a user interface for matching the data with the files, documents..
